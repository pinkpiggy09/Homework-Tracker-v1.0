// This is the first initial completed version of my homework tracker application. 
// The initial idea behind this was just to assist with my homework and later I decided to also audit my homework. 
// Initial build time was around an hour maybe a bit more. 
// The objective for this application is to improve upon it so that it becomes a multifaceted practice tool for math and an array of other subjects.
